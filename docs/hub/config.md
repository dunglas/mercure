# Configuration

The Mercure Hub follows [the twelve-factor app methodology](https://12factor.net/) and is configurable using [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable):

| `SUBSCRIBER_JWT_KEY`        | must contain the secret key to valid subscribers' JWT, can be omited if `JWT_KEY` is set                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `SUBSCRIBER_JWT_ALGORITHM`  | the JWT verification algorithm to use for subscribers, e.g. HS256 or RS512. Defaults to HS256.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `WRITE_TIMEOUT`             | maximum duration before timing out writes of the response, set to `0s` to disable (default), example: `2m`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `USE_FORWARDED_HEADERS`     | set to `1` to use the `X-Forwarded-For`, and `X-Real-IP` for the remote (client) IP address, `X-Forwarded-Proto` or `X-Forwarded-Scheme` for the scheme (http or https), `X-Forwarded-Host` for the host and the RFC 7239 `Forwarded` header, which may include both client IPs and schemes. If this option is enabled, the reverse proxy must override or remove these headers or you will be at risk. |

If `ACME_HOSTS` or both `CERT_FILE` and `KEY_FILE` are provided, an HTTPS server supporting HTTP/2 connection will be started.
If not, an HTTP server will be started (**not secure**).

When using RSA public keys for verification make sure the key is properly formatted.
