# Configuration

The Mercure Hub follows [the twelve-factor app methodology](https://12factor.net/) and is configurable using [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable):


| Variable                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

If this option is enabled, the reverse proxy must override or remove these headers or you will be at risk. |

If `ACME_HOSTS` or both `CERT_FILE` and `KEY_FILE` are provided, an HTTPS server supporting HTTP/2 connection will be started.
If not, an HTTP server will be started (**not secure**).
