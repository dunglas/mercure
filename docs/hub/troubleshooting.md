# Troubleshooting

## 401 Unauthorized

* Double-check that the request to the hub includes a `mercureAuthorization` cookie or an `Authorization` HTTP header
* If the cookie isn't set, you may have to explicitly include [the request credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch#Parameters) (`new EventSource(url, {withCredentials: true})` and `fetch(url, {credentials: 'include'})`)
* Check the logs written by the hub on `stderr`, they contain the exact reason why the token has been rejected
* Be sure to set a **secret key** (and not a JWT) in `JWT_KEY` (or in `SUBSCRIBER_JWT_KEY` and `PUBLISHER_JWT_KEY`)
* If the secret key contains special characters, be sure to escape them properly, especially if you set the environment variable in a shell, or in a YAML file (Kubernetes...)
* The publisher always needs a valid JWT, even if the `anonymous` directive is present in the `Caddyfile`, this JWT **must** have a property named `publish`. To dispatch private updates, the `publish` property must contain the list of topic selectors this publisher can use ([example](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJtZXJjdXJlIjp7InB1Ymxpc2giOlsiKiJdLCJzdWJzY3JpYmUiOlsiaHR0cHM6Ly9leGFtcGxlLmNvbS9teS1wcml2YXRlLXRvcGljIiwie3NjaGVtZX06Ly97K2hvc3R9L2RlbW8vYm9va3Mve2lkfS5qc29ubGQiLCIvLndlbGwta25vd24vbWVyY3VyZS9zdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zey90b3BpY317L3N1YnNjcmliZXJ9Il0sInBheWxvYWQiOnsidXNlciI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vdXNlcnMvZHVuZ2xhcyIsInJlbW90ZUFkZHIiOiIxMjcuMC4wLjEifX19.z5YrkHwtkz3O_nOnhC_FP7_bmeISe3eykAkGbAl5K7c))
* The subscriber needs a valid JWT only if the `anonymous` directive isn't present in the `Caddyfile`, or to subscribe to private updates, in this case the JWT **must** have a property named `subscribe` and containing an array of topic selectors ([example](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJtZXJjdXJlIjp7InB1Ymxpc2giOlsiKiJdLCJzdWJzY3JpYmUiOlsiaHR0cHM6Ly9leGFtcGxlLmNvbS9teS1wcml2YXRlLXRvcGljIiwie3NjaGVtZX06Ly97K2hvc3R9L2RlbW8vYm9va3Mve2lkfS5qc29ubGQiLCIvLndlbGwta25vd24vbWVyY3VyZS9zdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zey90b3BpY317L3N1YnNjcmliZXJ9Il0sInBheWxvYWQiOnsidXNlciI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vdXNlcnMvZHVuZ2xhcyIsInJlbW90ZUFkZHIiOiIxMjcuMC4wLjEifX19.z5YrkHwtkz3O_nOnhC_FP7_bmeISe3eykAkGbAl5K7c))

For both the `publish` property, the array can be empty to publish only public updates. For both `publish` and `subscribe`, you can use `["*"]` to match all topics.

## Browser Issues

If subscribing to the `EventSource` in the browser doesn't work (the browser instantly disconnects from the stream or complains about CORS policy on receiving an event), check that you've set a proper value for `cors_origins` in the `Caddyfile`. It's fine to use `cors_origins *` for local development.

## Mac OS Localhost Installation Error

How to process for Mercure to work in Mac OS Catalina:

* In the Finder on your Mac, locate the app that you want to open
* Control-click on the app icon, then choose "Open" from the shortcut menu
* Click "Open"

Then you will have a warning, ignore it and close the Terminal.

Open a new Terminal in the Mercure folder.

Then just start the server:

    ./mercure run

It will work. ðŸŽŠ
