# Load Test

According to a benchmark made by Glory4Gamers, the open source version of the Mercure.rocks hub is able to 40k concurrent connections on a single EC2 t3.micro instance.
It's even possible to handle way more connections by using [the HA version of the Mercure.rocks Hub](cluster.md).

To test your own infrastructure, we provide a [Gatling](https://gatling.io)-based load test. It allows to test any implementation of the protocol, including the open source Hub.

## Running the Load Test

1. Download [Gatling version 3](https://gatling.io/open-source/)
2. Clone the Mercure repository: `git clone https://github.com/dunglas/mercure`
3. Run `path/to/gatling/bin/gatling.sh --simulations-folder mercure/gatling/`

## Configuration

Available environment variables (all are optional):

 * `HUB_URL`: the URL of the hub to test
 * `JWT`: the JWT to use for authenticating the publisher
 * `SUBSCRIBER_JWT`: the JWT to use for authenticating the subsribers
 * `INITIAL_SUBSCRIBERS`: the number of concurrent subscribers initially connected
 * `SUBSCRIBERS_RATE_FROM`: minimum rate (per second) of additional subscribers to connect
 * `SUBSCRIBERS_RATE_TO`: maximum rate (per second) of additional subscribers to connect
 * `PUBLISHERS_RATE_FROM`: minimum rate (per second) of publications
 * `PUBLISHERS_RATE_TO`: maximum rate (per second) of publications
 * `INJECTION_DURATION`: duration of the publishers injection
 * `CONNECTION_DURATION`: duration of subscribers' connection
 * `RANDOM_CONNECTION_DURATION`: to randomize the connection duration (will longs `CONNECTION_DURATION` at max)
