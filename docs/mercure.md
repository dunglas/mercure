## Mercure in a Few Words

* native browser support, no lib nor SDK required (built on top of HTTP and [server-sent events](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/sse-websockets-data-flow-http2/))
* compatible with all existing servers, even those who don't support persistent connections (serverless architecture, PHP, FastCGI...)
* built-in connection re-establishment and state reconciliation
* [JWT](https://jwt.io/)-based authorization mechanism (securely dispatch an update to some selected subscribers)
* performant, leverages [HTTP/2 multiplexing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2/#request_and_response_multiplexing)
* designed with [hypermedia in mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS), also supports [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
* auto-discoverable through [web linking](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988)
* message encryption support
* can work with old browsers (IE7+) using an `EventSource` polyfill
* [connection-less push](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#eventsource-push) in controlled environments (e.g. browsers on mobile handsets tied to specific carriers)

The reference hub implementation:

* Fast, written in Go
* Works everywhere: static binaries and Docker images available
* Automatic HTTP/2 and HTTPS (using Let's Encrypt) support
* CORS support, CSRF protection mechanism
* Cloud Native, follows [the Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net) methodology
* Open source (AGPL)
