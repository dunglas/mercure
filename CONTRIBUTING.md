When you send a PR, make sure that:

* You add valid test cases.

  that you did not make in your PR, you're doing it wrong.

### Configuring Visual Studio Code

A configuration for VSCode is provided in the `.vscode/` directory of the repository.
It is automatically loaded by VS Code.           

### Finding Deadlocks

To debug potential deadlocks:

1. Install `go-deadlock`: `./tests/use-go-deadlock.sh`
2. Run the tests in race mode: `go test -race ./... -v`
3. To stress-test the app, run the load test (see `docs/load-testing.md`)
4. Be sure to remove `go-deadlock` before committing

## Spec

The spec is written in Markdown, compatible with [Mmark](https://mmark.miek.nl/).
It is then converted in the [the "xml2rfc" Version 3 Vocabulary](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7991).

To contribute to the protocol itself:

* Make your changes
* [Download Mmark](https://github.com/mmarkdown/mmark/releases)
* [Download `xml2rfc` using pip](https://pypi.org/project/xml2rfc/): `pip install xml2rfc`
* Generate the XML file: `mmark spec/mercure.md > spec/mercure.xml`
* Validate the generated XML file and generate the text file: `xml2rfc --text --v3 spec/mercure.xml`
* Remove non-ASCII characters from the generated `mercure.txt` file (example: K**é**vin)
* If appropriate, be sure to update the reference implementation accordingly
