## Protocol

The protocol is written in Markdown, compatible with [Mmark](https://mmark.nl/).
It is then converted in the [the "xml2rfc" Version 3 Vocabulary](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7991).

To contribute to the protocol itself:

* Make your changes
* [Download Mmark](https://github.com/mmarkdown/mmark/releases)
* [Download `xml2rfc` using pip](https://pypi.org/project/xml2rfc/): `pip install xml2rfc`
* Format the Markdown file: `mmark -markdown -w spec/mercure.md`
* Generate the XML file: `mmark spec/mercure.md > spec/mercure.xml`
* Add the `docName` attribute to the `<rfc>` element (example: `docName="draft-dunglas-mercure-04"`)
* Validate the generated XML file and generate the text file: `xml2rfc --text --v3 spec/mercure.xml`
* Remove non-ASCII characters from the generated `mercure.txt` file (example: K**é**vin)
* If appropriate, be sure to update the reference implementation accordingly
