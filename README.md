*Protocol and Reference Implementation*

Mercure is a protocol allowing to push data updates to web browsers and other HTTP clients in a convenient, fast, reliable and battery-efficient way.
It is especially useful to publish async and real-time updates of resources served through web APIs, to reactive web and mobile apps.

The protocol has been published as [an Internet Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-dunglas-mercure/) that [is maintained in this repository](spec/mercure.md).

A reference, production-grade, implementation of [**a Mercure hub**](docs/hub/install.md) (the server) is also available in this repository.
It's a free software (AGPL) written in Go. It is provided along with a library that can be used in any Go application to implement the Mercure protocol directly (without a hub) and an official Docker image.

In addition, a managed and high-scalability version of Mercure is [available in private beta](mailto:dunglas+mercure@gmail.com?subject=I%27m%20interested%20in%20Mercure%27s%20private%20beta).
